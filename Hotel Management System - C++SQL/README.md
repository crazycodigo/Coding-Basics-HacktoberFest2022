# Hotel Management System (C++)

### INSTRUCTIONS –

  o	Run the main.cpp file
  
  o	Command Line to run the code –
  
  	> g++ main.cpp -l sqlite3 -o main
    
  	> main.exe
    
    
##### OBJECTIVE –
The main idea of the objective is to build an environment for storage, collection and retrieval of data from database for hotels. 

##### REFERENCE –
  •	Class 12th Python Project which was similar to objective .

  •	Geekforgeeks for learning SQLAPI++ and sqlite3.

##### INTRODUCTION –
The objective can build an environment for storage, collection and retrieval of data from database for hotels.

Data is a necessary information that must be stored at some place for any organizations with lot of traffic. Hotel is such an important organization. This data can be used for many purposes such as details, security and also for perks like offers.

The project will give an environment for such purpose, in this project the authorities can store data with a simple CUI (Character User Interface), Calculate the Rent Amount, Automatically Allot a Free Room, Update the User Details (e.g., check out date, mobile number, etc.), the respective fare will be calculated. And also, if the customer leaves the hotel, his data will automatically shift to a database with old customer details.

##### TECHNOLOGY STACK – 
SOFTWARE USED – Visual Studio Code

•	The objective is using High Level Language C++ as its base language.

•	In the backend, the data will be stored in Real-Time Database Management System (RDBMS) SQL – Structured Query Language. This can be done by linking SQL with C++ using SQLAPI's sqlite3 package.

  o	Primary Key
  
  o	Different Tables for Different Purpose
  
•	C++ header files

   o	bits/stdc++.h – to include all the basic header files
  
   o	ctime – to get the system time information
  
   o	iomanip – to format/manipulate the output (time) 
  
   o	string – to use std :: string class
  
   o	files header files – to include different files to clean-up the code and make it more readable.
  
•	Object Oriented Programming Concepts.

### INSTRUCTIONS –
   o	Run the main.cpp file
  
   o	Command Line to run the code –
  
  	> g++ main.cpp -l sqlite3 -o main
    
  	> main.exe
